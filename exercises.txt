====Exercise 1: Bank Account ====
Create a BankAccount class, with a intereset_rate and a balance atributes.

Create a method call deposit and a method call withdraw and a method call withdraw.

====Exercise 2: Cats ====
Create a class called Cat

Every cat should have three attributes when they're created: name, preferred_food and meal_time.

Add an instance method called eats_at that returns the hour of the day with AM or PM that this cat eats.

Add another instance method called meow that returns a string of the cat telling you all about itself

====Exercise 3: Player ====
Create a class called Player.

Every player should have three attributes: gold_coins, health_points, and lives.

Lives should start at 5.

Gold coins should start at 0.

Health points should start at 10.

Your class should have an instance method called level_up that increases lives by one.

Your class should have an instance method called collect_treasure that increases gold_coins by one. If gold_coins is a multiple of ten (eg, 10, 20, 30, and so on) then the collect_treasure method should run the level_up method.

Your class should have an instance method called do_battle that accepts one damage argument and subtracts it from the player's health_points. If health_points falls below one, subtract one from lives and reset health_points to ten. If you have run out of lives, this method should run another method called restart (see below).

The restart instance method should set all attributes back to their starting values (5, 0, and 10).
